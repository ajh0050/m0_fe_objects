# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

There is a syntax error in the objects file that uses markdown but isn't commented out,
this threw me an error when I tried to use node objects.js to see my work. Took me a bit to figure
out what was causing the issue.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I don't really take notes i usually take screenshots

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I usually google.
